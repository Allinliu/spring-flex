        	TODO - An <code>AmfView</code> and <code>AmfHttpMessageConverter</code> are now provided with Spring BlazeDS Integration to 
        	support RESTful communication protocols as an alternative to direct RPC.  This is an especially attractive option when your 
        	application needs to support more than just a Flex client.  Complete documentation for the AMF support for the RESTful Spring 
        	MVC @Controller model will be provided in 1.5.0.RC1. For now, see the new <code>insync-rest</code> example that has been added 
        	to the <link linkend="samples">Test Drive</link>, which duplicated the full functionality of the complete inSync application 
        	that was originally built using BlazeDS Remoting.
