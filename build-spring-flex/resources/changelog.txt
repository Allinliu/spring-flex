Changes in version 1.0.1.RELEASE (09.23.2009)
-----------------------------------------
General
* The bundled Test Drive sample has undergone a good bit of general cleanup.  Most notably, it has been configured
to no longer run as the root web application, the naming conventions of the Spring configuration files have changed to
align with the conventions used in SpringSource Tool Suite project templates, and the Spring Security example has been
expanded to show how to take advantage of the extended functionality that the Spring Security integration provides over
the traditional BlazeDS security mechanisms.  See the specific Jira issues referenced below for further details.

* FLEX-62 - Configure the testdrive sample to not be deployed as the root web application.
