        <para>
        	Included in the project distribution is a collection of samples called the Spring BlazeDS Integration Test Drive.  This samples project is set up 
        	to be built with Maven and then imported into Eclipse for running the application via WTP.

    	<title>Building the Test Drive</title>
    	<para>
    		The sample build requires Maven 2.0.9 or greater.  Because the build compiles several seperate Flex and AIR projects, it can require setting the MAVEN_OPTS 
    		variable for your environment to allocate more memory than the default.  The setting we find works well is:

    	<programlisting><![CDATA[
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
]]>
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			Once your Maven environment is set up correctly, cd to {project distribution root}/spring-flex-samples/spring-flex-testdrive and execute:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[
mvn install
]]>
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			This will first build all of the individual Flex projects and then finally assemble the 'testdrive' WAR project.

    	<title>Importing and Running the Test Drive in Eclipse</title>
    	<para>
    		The individual Test Drive projects are pre-configured to be imported in Eclipse and run with WTP.  (There are a number of individual projects, so you may want to consider creating a fresh
    		workspace or at least create a new working set to manage the projects.)  We recommend using the free <ulink url="http://www.springsource.com/products/sts">SpringSource Tool Suite</ulink> to work with the samples so that you can take full 
    		advantage of its extensive Spring support, but any version of Eclipse 3.4 with WTP should work.  
    	</para>
    	<para>	
    		To import the samples, select File->Import...->General->Existing Projects into Workspace and navigate to the
    		{project distribution root}/spring-flex-samples/spring-flex-testdrive directory and import all of the projects found.
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		There is an individual project for each Flex sample, and one WTP project for the 'testdrive' WAR.  Once the projects have been imported, you can start the web application by selecting the 
    		'testdrive' project, right-clicking and selecting Run As->Run on Server.  The samples have been most thoroughly tested in Tomcat 6.0, but should run in any Servlet 2.4 container that WTP supports.  Once 
    		the application has started successfully, you can access the samples walk-through at http://localhost:8080/
