        <para>
        	Using a Spring-managed <code>MessageBroker</code> enables Spring beans to be easily exported for direct remoting calls from a Flex client.  This approach
        	is quite similar to that taken with other remoting technologies in the core Spring Framework.  Remoting is applied to existing Spring-managed beans
        	as an external configuration concern.  The <code>MessageBroker</code> transparently handles the process of serialization and deserialization between
        	the Flex AMF data format and Java. 
        </para>

    	<title>Configuring the Remoting Service</title>
    	<para>
    		The BlazeDS <code>RemotingService</code> has traditionally been configured by the inclusion of a remoting-config.xml file in the BlazeDS XML configuration.  When
    		using only Spring-managed remoting destinations, this config file can be left out completely as the inclusion of the <code>message-broker</code> tag
    		in your Spring configuration will cause the <code>RemotingService</code> to be configured with sensible defaults if none already exists at startup
    		time.  The end result is essentially equivalent to including the following minimal remoting-config.xml in your BlazeDS configuration:
    	</para>  	
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<service id="remoting-service"
    class="flex.messaging.services.RemotingService">

    <adapters>
        <adapter-definition id="java-object" class="flex.messaging.services.remoting.adapters.JavaAdapter" default="true"/>
    </adapters>

    <default-channels>
        <channel ref="my-amf"/>
    </default-channels>
    
</service>]]>    	
    	</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		Note that this assumes that there is already an equivalent application-wide <code>default-channels</code> configuration.  It is recommended that
    		you set the desired service-specific channels (see example below) if not relying on an application-wide default setup.  If no application-wide
    		defaults exist, a best guess will be made by configuring the first available channel from the <code>MessageBroker</code> that uses an 
    		<code>AMFEndpoint</code> as the default for the <code>RemotingService</code>.  
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		If you wish to have more explicit control over the defaults that will be set on the <code>RemotingService</code>, you can customize them
    		via the <code>remoting-service</code> child element of the <code>message-broker</code> tag.  For example:
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<flex:message-broker>
	<flex:remoting-service default-adapter-id="my-default-remoting-adapter" default-channels="my-amf, my-secure-amf" />
</flex:message-broker>]]>
		</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		If you have an existing remoting-config.xml for a legacy BlazeDS application, the <code>RemotingDestinationExporter</code> will be able to work transparently with it,
    		allowing you to gradually migrate to all Spring-managed remoting destinations.
    	</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="remoting-destination">
    	<title>Using the <code>remoting-destination</code> Tag</title>
    	<para>
    		The <code>remoting-destination</code> configuration tag can be used to export existing Spring-managed services for direct remoting from a Flex client.
    		Given the following Spring bean definition for a <code>productService</code> bean:
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[    
<bean id="productService" class="flex.samples.product.ProductServiceImpl" />]]>
    	</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		and assuming the existance of a Spring-managed <code>MessageBroker</code> configured via the <code>message-broker</code> tag, the following 
    		top-level <code>remoting-destination</code> tag will expose the service for remoting to the Flex client as a remote service destination named <code>productService</code>: 
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<!-- Expose the productService bean for BlazeDS remoting -->
<flex:remoting-destination ref="productService" />]]>
    	</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		By default, the remote service destination exposed to the Flex client will use bean name of the bean being exported as the service id of the 
    		destination, but this may be overridden using the <code>service-id</code> attribute on the <code>remoting-destination</code> tag.
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		An alternate way of using the <code>remoting-destination</code> tag is as a child element of an top-level bean definition.  This is even more concise 
    		and works well if you don't have a need to keep your domain-layer bean definitions separate from infrastructure concerns such as Flex remoting.  
    		(Keep in mind that keeping them separate can lead to easier testability of the core domain layer.)  The following achieves the equivalent result
    		to the previous example:  
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[    
<bean id="productService" class="flex.samples.product.ProductServiceImpl" >
	<flex:remoting-destination />
</bean>]]>
    	</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		The methods that are exposed to be called by the Flex client can be more tightly controlled through use of the <code>include-methods</code> and <code>exclude-methods</code>
    		attributes of the <code>remoting-destination</code> tag.  The BlazeDS channels over which the destination is exposed can also be controlled using the <code>channels</code> 
    		attribute.  (These attributes are available whether using the top-level or the nested version.)  A more extensively customized example would look something like:
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<flex:remoting-destination ref="productService" include-methods="read, update" exclude-methods="create, delete" channels="my-amf, my-secure-amf" />]]>
    	</programlisting>
    	<para>
    		The <code>remoting-destination</code> tag is transparently configuring a <code>RemotingDestinationExporter</code> bean instance for each bean being exported.  
    		The equivalent full bean syntax without the namespace support would be:
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
<!-- Expose the productService bean for BlazeDS remoting -->
<bean id="product" class="org.springframework.flex.remoting.RemotingDestinationExporter">
    <property name="messageBroker" ref="_messageBroker"/>
    <property name="service" ref="productService"/>
    <property name="serviceId" value="productService"/>
    <property name="includeMethods" value="read, update"/>
    <property name="excludeMethods" value="create, delete"/>
    <property name="channels" value="my-amf, my-secure-amf"/>
</bean>]]>

    <sect1 id="remoting-destination-annotation">
    	<title>Exporting Beans for Remoting with @RemotingDestination</title>
    	<para>
    		The @RemotingDestination annotation may be used as an alternative to the XML remoting-destination tag when using annotation-based 
    		Spring configuration.  @RemotingDestination is used at the type level to indicate the class being exported.  @RemotingInclude and 
    		@RemotingExclude are used at the method level to mark the methods that should be included and excluded for remoting.  
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		The following example illustrates the productService bean configured exclusively through annotations:
    	</para>
    	<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
package flex.samples.product;

import org.springframework.flex.remoting.RemotingDestination;
