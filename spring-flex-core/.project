  <comment>Spring BlazeDS Integration is a top-level Spring project, and a component of the complete Spring Web stack.  This 
    	project&apos;s purpose is to make it easier to build Spring-powered Rich Internet Applications using Adobe Flex as the 
    	front-end client.  It aims to achieve this purpose by providing first-class support for using the open source 
    	Adobe BlazeDS project and its powerful remoting and messaging facilities in combination with the familiar Spring 
    	programming model. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
